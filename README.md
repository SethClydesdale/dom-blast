# dom-blast

This was a short project that I worked on from 15 May to July 24, 2014.
I started it as practice for JavaScript as I was rather inexperienced at the time, and it was a good learning experience.
The plan was to create a silly little spaceship shooter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The endless wave of red triangles is enough to go insane.

## demo
You can try a demo of this game @ http://sethclydesdale.github.io/dom-blast/
